feel the wind?    
	it has finally started to blow away the dark clouds cloaking the moon,  
	there I realized,  
my heart, have been covered with my gloomy past,   
you as well, would leave me, is my aghast.  
	and when the moon was finally up in the sky,  
		shining so bright,  
		scattered everywhere was it's light.  
	a gaze from those pretty eyes,  
		and my heart would alight.  
	you are to hold my hands,  
		and my emotions delight.  
	for you to wear a smile so wide,    
		against the world I'd fight.  
	if you are to see me as yours,  
		higher than the skies would be our love's height.
