___

Where do I stop they ask me.
No. There is no limit.
There is no limit to my words, no limit to my imagination.
A wild mind wandering through the unknown, meddling with those creations
A mind with limitless possibilities.
A conscious full of dreams.
Here is the beginning of it all.
A journey
The beginning of a new world.
The moment where it all starts.
A mind that never rests.
A mind with a passion to explore.
A soul craving for an adventure.
Here I start,
Here I go...
