Been there for you... Been there on those depths of your deepest of nightmares, been there on the death of your emotions.
When you were broken and had no one by your side, been there on those dark scary nights.
When tears rolled down your cheeks and no one wiped them off your face, been there on those broken moments.
When no one stood by your side, been there on those loner days...
And now here I am, waiting at the doorway, hoping for your entrance. Here I am waiing for you to come and take me away from the ghosts of my creation.
Here I am waiting for the inevitable.
Here I am waiting for a friend....
