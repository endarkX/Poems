{Backstory: I recently saw an Instagram reel that read; if sins had an odor, would anyone sit next to you? Well here's the starting of my response, because apparently I won't sit still till I write a poem responding to the original post(yes something is clearly wrong with me)}



if sins had an odor,  
a poet would stench the smell of unholy.  
inks of blood, running down the innocent hearts,  
each song, an arsenal, unveiling lives slowly.
