___

it is always supposed to be 50/50,
but when you're a struggling 10, what if I can't be that 90?
when you're broken and down on your knee
what if I just can't be the eighty?
when you're your own greatest enemy,
what if I can't be your seventy?
whenever your sentiments all go drifty,
what if I lose out being the sixty?

it is supposed to be 50/50,
