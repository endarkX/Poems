___

I saw a dream,   
about you, and me.  
a divine land, misted from the world.  
a region magical; calm even when the ground hurled.  
a cloud of despair, always rose above my soul,  
when everyone turned their back, you stood up on your parole.  

I saw a dream,  
about you, and me.  
a vision, of our intimacy,  
a world where you're mine, and I'm yours  
and our blossom of ingenuity, an ecstasy.
