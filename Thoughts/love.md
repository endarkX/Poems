___

Maybe I love you, more than the stage of "crush",  
every time I'm around you, my heart starts to blush.  
whenever you're near me, I feel a different connection,  
yes maybe it's more than just a puppy affection.  

even in a crowd of thousands, I feel alone,  
in a world so comfortable, I only crave your zone.  

I'll wait for you,  
I'd wait a day, a month and more than just a year.  
hold my time for eternity, stay more than enough; be your adhere.
