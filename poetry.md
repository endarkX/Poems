Poetry...  
poetry never described anyone,  
neither it explained what's in your heart.  
Never once has it brought two souls together,  
it never either did dears apart.  

poetry...
they're just another tapestry of words jumbled,  
an effort to write about the world crumbed.  
a blank piece of canvas, with paints of lyrics ill-time,  
verses sang, tales told and stories in melodies gave poem its rhyme.
