___

they asked me:  
do you write???  
yes I do.  
yes my pen glides,  
roughly over a paper.  
those scribbles;  
the ink bleeds... my heart; my mind divides,  
my conscious goes numb, my emotions taper.  
so do you love? they asked:  
yes I do.  
I said I love you.  
this love, these emotions,  
makes my heart askew,  
bow towards you.  
So who's she?  
the question arose.  
and I listened to my heart.  
hearing the song it compose.  
the song, all about you,  
every verses anew.  
each line crafted,  
holds my mind accrue.  
So yes I write,  
Yes I do,  
All about you, all about you.
