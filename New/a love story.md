so this is how my love story started,  
a mere conversation was what I craved,  
first she drew-out her warm hands towards me,  
my heart, frightened from the world, into her heart, it caved.  



her heart held a fire of emotions,  
while mine feared isolation,  
when I was curled up in my ball of stormy thoughts,  
she stood, dispersing her light, calming my agitation.  



slowly I started accepting her warmth,  
her presence became my desire.  
my heard gave love another chance,  
she then, kissed me, and my soul burned a passionate fire.
