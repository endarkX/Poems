___

When you're forever gone: never to return,  
I promise not to shed a tear.  
I promise to walk through the pain,  
the sufferings shall I bear.  
Vowed to the present, of the sails we shared,  
I hold close your memories;  
and shall they accompany me near
shall I march towards eternity,  
with a bold heart, void of fear.  

`Â©Kendra Pokhrel`
