I lost myself that night,  
end of tunnel; I didn't see light  
for each of my problems;  
she was the one to fight.  
for what it's worth,  
her name is my cite.  
though it came to an end,  
she tried to make it right.  
the bond there was, was ending  
she was always to ignite.  
At last it was all over,  
And all I crave is a hug, warm and tight.
