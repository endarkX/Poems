Just a calming moment, a side shared with you, and a small thought.  
I've come to realize how much I've missed you.  
Though it's been not more than a couple days,  
For this little moment, my heart ablaze.  
Couldn't help but think, what I will do to make it happen forever and ever. The sacrifices I'd make, the losses I'd bear just to share another moment with you. Go
