she's crazy, this girl i know...  
every little things, her emotions aglow.  
it's you I'm talking about, you're the one who's wild,  
a slight change around you, you turn into a child.  
a bit weird, and really very warm,  
small talks with you, and my heart, fills with spirit swarm.  
With every call, you give me a gut full blue,  
emotion flows, heartbeat ascends, and all I think about is, I love you.
