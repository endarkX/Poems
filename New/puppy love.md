when I realized, was it too late.  
when I realized, my just a crush turned more.  
small attraction of mine turned into a sea of love,  
each of my thoughts were driven ashore.  
when I realized,  
my puppy love had me await,  
a mere infatuation, foolish emotions,  
everything else below, a silly desire was all above,  
as I realized, it was too late.  
it was too late to take a stand,  
as I have already fell down on my knees,  
the one thing I feared the most,  
I realized, I've been on freeze.  
was it too late,    
when I only realized?  
this crush of mine turned  
into the subject of my poems,  
what every passionate lover desired.
