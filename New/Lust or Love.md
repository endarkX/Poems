____

A wave of crazy and chaotic thoughts travelling through the untamed universe lifts me up, channels me to you.  
Towards your physical body and that holy spirit of yours.  
My idle view of you, a view so mesmerizing, soothing and so calming that it carries me away to a world.  
A world of love, a world of lust. A world of your eternal beauty.  
My maniacal persuasion, leading me through the reality of madden, taking me towards you and your creation of affection and lecherousness.  
Following the path paved, I find myself ambit within you, I see myself craving for you, I fancy my desire for our intimacy.
