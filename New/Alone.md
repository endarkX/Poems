___

that constant fear,  
the fear of falling behind even when you're running,  
the fear of being alone, even when all are around you,  
the fear of losing, even after you've won,  
the fear of being a failure,  
the fear is there, always...  
even in a crowd of thousands, when you're always held tight,  
even when everyone's against you, for you they're ready to fight,  
for the passage of times, they're always standing with you,  
for days, months and years and for eons too.  
even then you fear yourself of lacking,  
you feel everyone around you backing.  
even when they're there trying to be your backbone,  
all you fear is of always being alone.
