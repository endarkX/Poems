___


A light forest, within a stream running down singing the songs of jungle, lightening up the trees, the wildlife. The stream runs down with clarity.
A day as expressed by someone deeply in love.
A day when the weather is a pleasant contrast of spring and autumn. The air is fragrant with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the gentle breeze carries with it the promise of something magical. Dry leaves scattered on the ground, where within a path paved through the leaves. The path with the crunch of leaves and twigs. The path going through the forest, leading to a world of love and essence. Light calming and soothing breezes travelling across the fores, swirling the leaves along. The wind's gentle embrace like a lullaby for the soul.
The path ahead was a serene one, covered in the golden hues of autumn leaves. Yet, my heart was anything but calm as I stood there with my beloved, struggling to find the words to express my feelings. We had both held back for so long, afraid that our love would not be returned. But in that moment, as we stood there gazing into each other's eyes, I knew that I could no longer hide my love. With a trembling voice, I began to speak, pouring out all that was in my heart. Her eyes widened in surprise, and then a smile slowly spread across her face. It was then that I knew that my love had been reciprocated all along.

As I stood there with her, my heart pounding within my chest, I knew that it was now or never. With a gentle touch, I ran my fingers through her hair, feeling the soft strands against my skin. I turned her towards me, gazing into her eyes, and felt my heart skip a beat. In that moment, all that mattered was her and the love that I had been holding back for far too long.

And then, as we stopped to applaud the artistry around us, I held her hands and turned her towards me. With a deep breath, I began to speak.

"My love, I have been holding back for so long, afraid to express my love towards you. But I cannot hold it any longer. I love you more than anything in the world, and I need you in my life. Without you, there is only darkness in my life."

I could see the eyes tearing up as she looked up at me, and I knew that I had finally found the spirit to articulate my feelings.

I asked her to gaze into my eyes, to observe the depths of my love. I wanted to let her  know that she was the one I had ever needed, the one who had captured my heart completely. With every breath, every moment, I had been searching for her, yearning to find her and never let her go.

Embracing her in my arms, I let my devotion speak for me, kissing her with a depth of feeling that left us both enraptured. It was a kiss that promised a future together, a life filled with love and passion.

As we stood there, lost in each other's embrace, I knew that we had found our forever in each other's arms. The wind continued to swirl the leaves around us, but in that moment, nothing else mattered except the love that we shared.
