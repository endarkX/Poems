I'm a book open,  
    my pages to everyone,  
    stories within, touched by none.  

I'm a book open,  
    my chapters about pain, 
    how a soul was broken.  

A tale,  
  a story of a heart frail,  
an empty shell,  
   a lifeless body prevail.  

This is a chronicle,  
     about my life,  
a stage of war,  
    mind and my heart strife.  

I'm a book open,  
    my pages, worn and torn,  
    my silent story, unspoken.
