#intimacy

___

Sex isn't an act, it's a feeling.

___


A feeling of being with her, a feeling of together
an emotion of bond that tether.
Intimacy in between a couple sweethearts,
as if fabricated albeit the divinity's arts.

A pledge persistent to be held,
an ardor potent for me to yield.
complicated sentiments of voyeur,
motives me by your amour.
